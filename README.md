### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Yasir and am an aspiring Data Analyst with over 2 years of experience in Education, Tech & Manufacturing sectors and now looking to make professional inroads into the world of Data. I'm currently pursuing my master's in Business Analytics at Aston University to deepen my expertise in the said field.

I also hold a Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering from Coventry University. I would love to connect/collaborate with like minded people, so feel free to drop a message on my [Email](yasir.savanur@gmail.com) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yasir-savanur/). Cheers!
