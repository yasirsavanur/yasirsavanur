### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Yasir and am an aspiring Data Analyst with over 2 years of experience in Education, Tech & Manufacturing sectors, and now looking to make professional inroads into the world of Data. I really enjoy learning languages and frameworks such as PySpark.

I have a Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering from Coventry University. I would love to connect with like minded people, so feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yasir-savanur/). Cheers!
